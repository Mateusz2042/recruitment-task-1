## General advice:

- You can take a look around the project and change every part of it, but all the tasks can be achieved by:
  - Modifying the [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx) 
  - Creating and modifying files in [`/components`](./src/components/) folder.
- We advise you to do the tasks in order, most of them built upon each other.
