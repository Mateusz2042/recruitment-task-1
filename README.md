## Prelude

The following task is a great opportunity to show us your experience, style, and the way you work and impress us with your skills and knowledge.

## Description

## General advice:

- You can take a look around the project and change every part of it, but all the tasks can be achieved modifying only the [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx) and files in [`/components`](./src/components/) folder.
- We advice you to do the tasks in order, most of them built upon each other.
